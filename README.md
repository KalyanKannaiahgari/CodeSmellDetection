# Code Smell Detection
Code smells are signs of subpar design and implementation decisions that have a negative impact on the standard of written source code. 


## Instructions to run the project
- This project is written in **Python** programming language.
- This project should be executed on **PyCharm** IDE **ONLY**.
- It includes a csv file named "codeSmellData.csv". This file includes datasets which is imported from Kaggle.

## Code Parameters
1.	Repetitive Code Lines
2.	Dead Code
3.	Multiple Return statements
4.	Long statements
5.	Same function names
6.	Long blocks of classes of methods
7.	Long loop blocks
8.	Long Conditional blocks
9.	Long Parameter/Variable list

All the above parameters are considered to determine the efficiency of the code and to detect code smells.

## Tools used
- Infusion
- JDeodrant
- PMD

All the above tools are imported from the “DictWrite” library in the source code.
